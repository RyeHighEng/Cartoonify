# Image Processing Final Project 

The purpose of this project is to create an application which turns a monochrome or colored image into a cartoonified version. To accomplish this a specific algorithm needed to be implemented.

1. Find Edge Map: XDoG Filter
2. Color Quantization: K-Mean Clustering
3. Cartoonify: Product of XDoG and K-Mean Clustering
